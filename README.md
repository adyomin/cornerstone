This repository is a part of my effort to familiarize myself with git and github, and deep learning.  Since it has no value other than educational, feel free to browse and clone.  In doing so please use your best judgement to strike a balance between using these materials and staying in compliance with the applicable Honor Code(s).

The code itself is currently work in progress @ very early stages.  And it makes no sense to annotate and/or explain it in any way.  If you got here by yourself, it is on you.  If you got here following a link from me, I bet you have all the instructions you need.

Most of the code is inspired by:
 - my deepest passion for figuring out machine intelligence
 - Udacity's Deep Learning Foundations nano degree program
 - Stanford's CS231n (winter 2016 offering) course
 - 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning' by Michael Nielsen

Once I figure out licensing, I will add a proper open source license to the project.  All the data sets are property of the respective owners/providers.  I will do my best to mention them.

I will also do my best to keep giving credit where it is due throughout the life of the project, because I believe that acknowledging original work is important for many reasons.  Being truly grateful to all the people who generously share their work with others being one of them.
