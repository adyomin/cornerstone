## About the project

The goal of this project is to follow along [Udacity's Deep Learning 
Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) to the best 
of my abilities recreating most of the ideas in plain Python.  I am not 
currently planning on any GPU support in any of the implementations.

Since it has no value other than educational, feel free to browse and clone. 
In doing so please use your best judgement to strike a balance between using 
these materials and staying in compliance with the applicable Honor Code(s). 
 Please do not use any of it for anything performance critical.  It is 
 provided 'as is'.  

Most of the code is inspired by:
 - My deepest passion for figuring out machine intelligence
 - [Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)
 - [Stanford's CS231n (winter 2016 offering) course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)
 - [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by Michael Nielsen

None of it is a direct copy of anyone's work, it is my own take on the basic 
ideas of deep learning.  Once I figure out licensing, I will add an 
appropriate license.  All the data sets are property of the respective 
owners/providers.


## Backpropagation

Understanding backpropagation was somewhat challenging for at first, 
especially the way Udacity originally taught it in the course (they are 
currently changing the materials based on the feedback, hope it will make 
them more easier to digest for someone who is not intimately familiar with 
optimization problems).

[This forum post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/slightly-different-way-to-look-at-backpropagation/219763) might be a good place to start should you decide to take 
a look at the code and run into any troubles understanding what is going on 
there.


## Do you want to contribute? 

Should you for some reason decide to contribute, please be assured that your 
time, expertise and consideration would be very much appreciated.  I hope 
that at least my wife and one of my friends will use this repository figuring
 out deep learning.
   
I guess the easiest and most obvious way would be to open an issue explaining
 what you believe can be done to increase readability of the code (since this is
  an educational project first of all) and/or performance (but readability 
  comes first).
